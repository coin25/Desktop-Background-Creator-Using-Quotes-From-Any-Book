# Desktop-Background-Creator-Using-Quotes-From-Any-Book

Creates desktop backgrounds using quotes from any book.

How to use:
1. Take any desired images for the background and add it to the "Wallpapers" folder.
2. Take any desired quotes and add it to the "Quotes.txt" file.
  Note that I would read the book using "Moon + Reader" for android and highlight the quotes I desired, then easily export these to the txt
3. Run the script.
